# create an esp32 based Current and Voltage CANBus controller for the 4000W Huawai R4875G1 battery charger This is a cheap and fast project to turn this power brick into a Home Assistant controlled (or Node Red controlled) Home Battrey Storage Charger.
It uses CAN-Bus communication to send Voltage and Current settings (permanent and transient) to the charger. It also allows the charger to be hibernated and woken up via Homeassistant automeations.
